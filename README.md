# Hello World

A simple Hello World example that utilizes React, WebPack, & Babel.

## Installation

npm i -dd -g webpack-dev-server
npm i -dd
```

## Run

### For *nix Systems

```
npm start
```

### For Windows Systems

```
webpack-dev-server --progress --colors

The separate command is needed for Windows, otherwise you'll be left with a 
zombie process if the user exits with CTRL+C.
