# Hello World

A simple Hello World example that utilizes React, WebPack, & Babel.

The point of this is to demonstrate how to drop transpiled React components
onto an ES5 page, and how to then interact with them. The interaction occurs
within `public/js/page.js` where it adds the components to the DOM and sets
custom data on the second component instance.
